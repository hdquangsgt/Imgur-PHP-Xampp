\n<p>Being young means exploring the world and experiencing different cultures and places. Some choose to stay in their home country, while others visit a far-away country or perhaps take on a challenging activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty-one-year-old Amelia Milling, who is deaf, isn’t afraid of challenging herself and decided to climb a mountain in Alaska by herself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But something went wrong and she ran fell hundreds of feet down the mountain. Then a rescue helicopter found her — but to their amazement, she wasn’t alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amelia Milling likes adventure. While most people her age might prefer beach holidays or playing with their smartphones, she has other interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\" id=\"attachment_4358\"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SOJDai6.jpg"><figcaption>Youtube</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Amelia decided to go on a three-day hike in Alaska, and at first, everything was going well. Amelia, who is deaf, started the climb up a large mountain — when everything went wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow, Amelia lost her balance and fell down the side of the snow-covered mountain. She slid more than 300 feet before she crashed into a boulder and then slid another 300 feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\" id=\"attachment_4361\"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qXPKMzS.jpg"><figcaption>Youtube</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 21-year-old was stranded alone on the mountain. Luckily, though, she didn’t break any bones and could still walk. But she did have a big problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since she had fallen so far, Amelia had no idea where she was. She was lost in an unfamiliar landscape and was wondering what she could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freezing and with over 24 hours having passed since her fall, Amelia knew that she was in trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\" id=\"attachment_4366\"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VUb5YpB.jpg"><figcaption>Youtube</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But soon after, something happened that made Amelie’s heart jump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the distance, she saw what looked like a white wolf. Amelia was worried because she knew how wolves acted around people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when the white canine came closer, Amelie saw that it was wearing a collar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\" id=\"attachment_4367\"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/J8y5Z9w.jpg"><figcaption>Youtube</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The husky, whose name is Nanook, had “guide” written on his collar and was actually a trail guide dog that worked on the mountain finding lost hikers and bringing them back to the trail. Talk about finding the right dog at the right time!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\" id=\"attachment_4360\"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ww867JG.jpg"><figcaption>Youtube</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Nanook had found Amelia and had a new mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nanook helped Amelia find the trail again and stayed with her all night to make sure she wasn’t alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, Amelia tried to cross a river, but the strong currents pulled her underwater.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, Nanook was right there for her. He jumped in, grabbed the strap on her backpack and pulled her out of the cold glacier water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amelia had a GPS transmitter so she could send a signal if anything happened, and she finally decided to press it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\" id=\"attachment_4362\"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nifuFeP.jpg"><figcaption>Youtube</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The signal was picked up by the local rescue service, who sent a helicopter to find her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alaska State Troopers were called out to her location and delivered her to safety, with Nanook by her side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the rescuers flew her home, she claims that Nanook is her true hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The dog was a real help,” police chief Eric Olsen told
